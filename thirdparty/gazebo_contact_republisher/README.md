# gazebo_contact_republisher
publishes a custom rostopic message from the gazebo::msgs:contacts gz topic


The need for this whole thing arrises from the lack of communication tools between Gazebo and Matlab. 
Maybe this is because I don't understand correctly how to use them.
Anyway, this solves my problem. I hope it helps solve yours too.

Don't expect maintenance on this package, as of this date I plan only to use it as it is.

You can ask questions but keep in mind that you probably know more than me about ROS or gazebo.
